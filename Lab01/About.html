            <h3>Character Details</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px">It is unlikely that travelers from other nations will understand why the god of this land is regarded as a "superstar" unless they set foot in the Opera Epiclese.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Whether at performances or trials, she will always be in the seat reserved for her above the audience, laughing, scolding, falling into hysterics, to the point where more often than not she makes a stronger impression than the action onstage.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">People buy tickets to indulge in new sensory experiences, and in this regard, Furina is by far more popular than the absolute justice that Neuvillette represents.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">The forms respect can take are not limited to just lifting one's eyes up to a being above, and the unique form of respect Fontainians have for Furina is perhaps described better as "affection and fondness."</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">She is not perfect, and may not even be very powerful, but while onstage, she is the personage the people trust the most, for she never disappoints.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Among Fontainian literary circles, there is a popular saying that Furina is a memory of spring never-fading, present in the hearts of all. And who does not wish for an eternal spring?</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Spring is transient, but she is ever there — follow the stage lights, and you shall see her.</p>

            <h3>Character Story 1</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px">As the icon of the Opera Epiclese, Furina has the right to speak freely during all stages of a trial.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Most of her questions are born from her curiosity and often have tenuous logical connections with the case at best, which at times can provoke raucous bursts of laughter from the audience.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">But just as one might begin to suspect that Furina is just there for laughs and gags, and lacks even the capability to grasp the case in its entirety, she throws out opinions worth their weight in gold.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Of course, there are also times when she will express little interest in the whole process due to having earlier eaten snacks ill to her liking or missed some parade, but it is said that audience members lucky enough to be there are still pleased with this, as a god who speaks in anger is equally enchanting.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">There is but one circumstance in which she will not appear to act quite so willfully, and that is when she takes the stage as an actress in a musical.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Fontaine has a great many musical theater classics passed down from antiquity that are, from time to time, performed at the Opera Epiclese, with key roles being played by the most popular actors of the day.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Before such productions are put on, there is a phase during preparations that resembles nothing so much as a lucky draw, where the troupe will send Furina an invitation. Should the mood strike her, she will agree to appear, resulting in a stage shared by a god and humans.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Once Furina has agreed to participate, the performance date for that show becomes a Fontainian festival in its own right, so popular that the Opera Epiclese couldn't possibly meet the fervent demand even if they sold nothing but standing tickets and were filled to capacity.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">And when the music sounds and a god takes the stage, the audience will see not their lovable deity, who does as she pleases, but the character in the script.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Whether majestic or valiant, conniving or covetous, Furina is a dab hand at playing them all, perfect down to the last gesture, as if she were born to act.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">And it is because of her record of wondrous performances that she very much deserves to be called "superstar" by her people.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Even a famous reporter from The Steambird who had barely squeaked their way backstage was completely awestruck, such that it was a long while before they remembered the interview questions in their notebook.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">"Lady Furina, might I ask how you were able to attain such great mastery acting as an Archon, though no one has ever seen you practice?"</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Furina's reply was proud, albeit uncharacteristically simple. "Why, because I am a god. Next question!"</p>

            <h3>Character Story 2</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Cases and performances take up a great deal of Furina's time, and even without these two things, she still shows up for all kinds of social activities and dinner parties related to government business and diplomacy.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Of course, social engagement is usually the limit of her remit, while the real behind-the-scenes work, and sometimes even certain important speeches made during these interactions, are handled by others.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Furina is quite thankful for these proxies, for she has heard that her life of leisure is a rare privilege in a world where most other gods have an endless parade of duties large and small to attend to.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">She once considered that it might be right to set a... godly example, so to speak, and so she attempted to take part in the Palais Mermonia's day-to-day work when she had an excessive amount of free time on her hands...</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">However, her offers were respectfully yet consistently declined by both humans and Melusines, who insisted that "there are no great duties at present that need to be handed over to our god."</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Though these words did make her glad, of course, after a few attempts she quickly realized how impractical it would be to use the work of the Palais Mermonia to escape her boredom.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Furina actually has another hobby, known to very few, and that is playing with little animals.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Fontaine's waterscapes are vast and beautiful, as well as blessed with innumerable adorable creatures. For one who always finds herself interacting with humans like Furina, this serves as an excellent change of pace.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">However, animal habits are inconsistent and unpredictable, and Furina's carefree attitude always seems to rub them the wrong way. As in the "if she's not being blasted in the face by Hat Jellyfish, then she's being pursued to the ends of the ocean by Hunter's Rays" kind of wrong way.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">It can be argued that the underwater world is more primitive and wild than the surface world, considering how little respect the animals here give a god on account of her status alone.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Nonetheless, Furina did eventually discover the animal for her ministrations — the sunbathing, beach-loving, horizontal alignment-enjoying Blubberbeasts.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Cheek squeezes, belly rubs, and even flipping them over, then over again, gets at most a turn of the head and noiseless protest.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">"Hmm? You like it? Hehe, so do I!"</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">A few mild miscommunications aside, they have since become the best of friends.</p>
