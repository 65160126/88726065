            <h3>Character Details</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Neuvillette is a solitary person.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Fontainians who have tried to get close to him have, without exception, been politely rejected. To this day, no one even knows his first name, since he has always asked that he be referred to by his last name.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">He believes that close personal ties will lead to suspicions about the justness of one's judgments, while he must remain a symbol of absolute justice.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Of course, there will always be people who just won't give up. They will say, "Come now, Monsieur Neuvillette. Not everyone will stand trial, nor will you always have to remain in the judge's seat."</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">But is that really the case? If there is an answer in his heart, Neuvillette will not reveal it.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Given enough time, every river will overflow and flood. Every last Fontainian is guilty, with judgment and doom certain to one day fall upon them — this is neither metaphor nor rhetoric.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Yet, Neuvillette can share this fact with no one.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">Truly, he is a lonesome person.</p>

            <h3>Character Story 1</h3>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Neuvillette is not known for his personal desires.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Curious members of the public and journalists are wont to seek high and low for him all across Fontaine when he is not sitting in the Chief Justice's seat of judgment. He may sit at a seat for specially invited guests during performances, appear by the shore when the skies are just on the cusp of weeping, or be standing within the shadows cast by the afternoon sun.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">There was once a time when all believed that he was some kind of demon who existed solely to preside over trials and judge, forcing him to clarify that... Well, the gist of it was "to bear witness and judge is my great honor, but I am not a trial aficionado. Iudex is simply one of the hats I wear, and my time as a judge is but one phase of my life."</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">This successful clarification led him out of the frying pan, and into the fire, as they say — "Shocking News! Neuvillette Claims 'Iudex' to be 'Springboard' Post! Unspeakable Plans Next; Where Will His Ambition End?"</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">As for the new rumors, Neuvillette paid them no heed. Perhaps they were, in fact, right on the Mora, and he simply did not correct them out of principle? No one knows.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">Neuvillette is also not much of a drinker, nor does he like Fonta — indeed, he has never even been known to have given any sincere praise to the local chefs' most renowned dishes. This has led people to suspect that his lack of consumptive desire might come down to him simply not having a sense of taste.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">His response was to organize a water-tasting salon party, at which all were gobsmacked by the wide variety of flavors water from different regions could possess and floored by the Iudex's most refined tastes. Of course, the amount of authenticity present in such interactions cannot be known.</p>
            <p style="font-size:20px">But whatever the case, Neuvillette really is devoid of selfish want.</p>

            <h3>Character Story 2</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Neuvillette is a just person.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">If not for that quality, he probably would not have been qualified to serve as the Iudex in the first place.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">To the children, the job of the man in the judge's seat is nothing more than wearing a wig, maintaining order in the court, and being the Oratrice's messenger pigeon. In truth, however, there are many administrative affairs that he must handle in private to keep the justice system up and running.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Due to certain historical and traditional legacies in Fontaine, the Iudex also has the right to prosecute, as well as the power to enforce the law in person. This was originally intended to make it easier to maintain law and order during chaotic times, but as the system became further refined, this rule, which represented the spirit of the pioneer far more than that of the law, became maintained only symbolically. When the Iudex investigates a case or serves as the prosecutor, they must recuse themselves as judge, and have someone else take the seat. And in the few instances where he has personally investigated cases, Neuvillette has unerringly followed this rule.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">One thing to note is that he has been the only Iudex in the land for a very long time, so much so that people often speculate that he must have been given an unimaginably long life due to divine favor. As such, it is well that he is nothing if not fair-minded, or such an extensive term would surely lead to problems someday.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">As to what he is precisely — a familiar of the Hydro Archon, or a mysterious Hydro elemental creature, perhaps — there are a great many opinions, though Neuvillette has never once commented on such talk.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Indeed, he is a person most impartial.</p>
